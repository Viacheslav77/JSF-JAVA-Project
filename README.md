# JSF-JAVA-Project-uses-MySQL-database

<p><b>In this project I use: Java EE technology, GlassFish application server, MySQL database and external libraries PrimeFaces and BootFaces.</b></p>
<p>At the first stage, the project demonstrates products. So I use SQL to query the data in the database. In the future I will transfer it to Hibernate.</p>
<p>This diagram shows the structure of my database. I used the principles of OOP in designing its architecture.</p>
